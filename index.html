            This is a tool designed to evaluate your current level of knowledge
            of kanji (Chinese characters) used in Japanese. You will be
            presented characters and asked to select the correct pronunciation
            and meaning in English in a multiple choice format. At the end of
            the test, you will be given an estimate of the approximate amount of
            kanji you know.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal of the test is to give you an idea of how many kanji you
            know in order to help you evaluate your current level and guide your
            study goals. The test will take approximately 5-10 minutes to
            complete. Please consider giving feedback for this tool if you found
            it useful or interesting. Thank you for taking the time to try out
            this tool!

            <h1>Test Your Kanji Knowledge</h1>
            <p>
              The goal of this test is to estimate the amount of kanji you know.
              You will be presented with a kanji prompt, and be asked to select
              the correct reading and English definition from four choices. If
              you do not know the answer, you can simply click the "I don't
              know" button. Submitting "I don't know" has the exact same effect
              as submitting an incorrect answer. You are encouraged, however, to
              not guess if you are unsure of the correct answer. Guessing or
              using process of elimination when you are unsure of the answer
              will result in a more inaccurate calculation of your knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
              The test should take 5-10 minutes. You must complete the entire
              test to see your results.
            </p>
            <p>
              Results given are an estimation. If you would like a more accurate
              calculation of your knowledge, try taking the test multiple times
              and averaging your results.
            </p>
            <p>Good luck!</p>

            <p>
              This tool was developed with the purpose of assisting you in
              estimating your proficiency in Kanji (Chinese characters used in
              Japanese). It utilizes a curated list of the 6,355 most frequently
              used Kanji. The test prompts have been randomized, ensuring a
              distinct experience each time you undertake the assessment. While
              the application's algorithm has been carefully designed to
              accurately evaluate your knowledge, the inherent variability of
              the randomized test prompts may result in score fluctuations
              between evaluations. I recommend taking the test multiple times
              and averaging the results to obtain a more precise assessment of
              your proficiency.
