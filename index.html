            This is a tool designed to evaluate your current level of knowledge
            of kanji (Chinese characters) used in Japanese. You will be
            presented characters and asked to select the correct pronunciation
            and meaning in English in a multiple choice format. At the end of
            the test, you will be given an estimate of the approximate amount of
            kanji you know.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal of the test is to give you an idea of how many kanji you
            know in order to help you evaluate your current level and guide your
            study goals. The test will take approximately 5-10 minutes to
            complete. Please consider giving feedback for this tool if you found
            it useful or interesting. Thank you for taking the time to try out
            this tool!

            <p>
              The goal of this test is to estimate the amount of kanji you know.
              You will be presented with a kanji prompt, and be asked to select
              the correct pronunciation and definition from four choices. If you
              do not know the answer, you can simply click the "I don't know"
              button. Submitting "I don't know" has the exact same effect as
              submitting an incorrect answer. You are encouraged, however, to
              not guess if you are unsure of the correct answer. Guessing or
              using process of elimination when you are unsure of the answer
              will result in a more inaccurate calculation of your knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
              The test should take 5-10 minutes. You must complete the entire
              test to see your results.
            </p>
            <p>
              Results given are an estimation. If you would like a more accurate
              calculation of your knowledge, try taking the test multiple times
              and averaging your results.
            </p>
            <p>Good luck!</p>

              This tool was developed with the purpose of assisting you in
              estimating your proficiency in Chinese characters (kanji). It
              utilizes a curated list of the 6,000 most frequently used Chinese
              characters, identified by the PRC Ministry of Education. The test
              prompts have been randomized, ensuring a distinct experience each
              time you undertake the assessment. While the application's
              algorithm has been carefully designed to accurately evaluate your
              knowledge, the inherent variability of the randomized test prompts
              may result in score fluctuations between evaluations. I recommend
              taking the test multiple times and averaging the results to obtain
              a more precise assessment of your proficiency.

            <h3>Known Issues</h3>
            <p>
              Some entries for meaning or pronunciation may contain errors or
              provide information that renders the answer obvious. If you come
              across such instances, please report them, and I will promptly
              rectify the issue.
            </p>
            <p>
              While certain characters may have multiple possible readings, for
              practical reasons, most characters are associated with a single
              pronunciation. If you find that the pronunciation provided for an
              answer is not the most common one or believe that including an
              additional secondary pronunciation is crucial, please inform me,
              and I will review the matter on a case-by-case basis.
            </p>
            <p>
              Certain characters may not possess a distinct meaning on their own
              but are specifically associated with a particular word. For such
              characters, the definition provided refers to the meaning within
              the word where the character is commonly found.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some characters exhibit different standard pronunciations in
              Taiwan. While I am actively working on incorporating both
              pronunciation variants, this process is time-consuming as it
              requires each change to be made manually. Please feel free to let
              me know if you would like a Taiwanese pronunciation variant to be
              included or if you encounter any pronunciation choices that may be
              misleading.
            </p>
            <p>
              Handling the correct answer for the definition of characters
              exclusively used in names can be challenging. In such cases, the
              only definition provided for these characters may be "a surname"
              or "used in names." Your recommendations for addressing such
              characters are welcome and greatly appreciated.
